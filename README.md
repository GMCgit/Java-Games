# Some syntax in the game!

## "#" is a wall
  You can't pass through those!

## "." is background
  Does nothing!

## "P" is you, the player!
  Try moving it!

## "O" is a block
  You can mobe it by hitting it

## "X" is a target
  You need to push the block there

## "D" is a death block
  It's a work in progress
